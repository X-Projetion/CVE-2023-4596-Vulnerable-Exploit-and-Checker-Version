# Known errors
**[-] Could not extract forminator_nonce** <br>
This exploit only works when a link is provided of the exact page where the file upload is enabled with Forminator. When a link is provided with just the domain or a page that is not running a file upload on it, it spits out an error. This is because it exports the forminator_nonce from the provided URL and if this page is not running Forminator or the Forminator file upload, it can't find the value and can't use it. You can also check by finding the string "forminator-field-post-image-postdata" in the source code of the site. A full link, for example, looks like this: `http://localhost:1337/?p=7`.
